# Solving-a-Night-with-the-Nerds
This project was created for my advanced computer programming class as my final project. We were tasked with using a new language to create a project of our choice. I decided to make a fun murder mystery text adventure in Go or Golang.

If anyone wants to try and play the game without downloading the code a link to the game is hosted on repl.it here:
